Detection of license plates in a photo using Opencv.


INTRODUCTION

The aim of this work is to develop a license plate detection system capable of identifying all its characters. To this end, various image conditioning methods and techniques have been used.
The system is divided into 3 parts, which work together:
- Character recognition, identifying individual characters already isolated from the rest of the image;
- Character separation, taking an image with just the license plate, being able to isolate each of its characters.
- License plate location, from an image of an entire car, be able to locate the license plate and isolate it.
